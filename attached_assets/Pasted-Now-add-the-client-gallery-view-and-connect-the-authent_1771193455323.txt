Now add the client gallery view and connect the authentication:

1. FIRST, FIX LOGIN (connect frontend to backend):
   - Update Login.jsx to actually call POST /api/auth/login
   - Store JWT token in localStorage
   - Redirect to dashboard on success
   - Show error message on failure
   - Add loading state to button

2. CLIENT GALLERY PAGE (Route: /gallery/:token):
   - Create new component: ClientGallery.jsx
   - Fetch gallery data from GET /api/share/:token
   - Show loading skeleton while fetching
   - If gallery not found, show "Gallery not found" message

3. GALLERY HEADER (Pixieset style):
   - Gallery title (large, bold)
   - Client name (gray text)
   - Photo count (e.g., "24 photos")
   - Download All button (blue, rounded-full) - appears only when photos exist
   - Select All checkbox (visible on hover of header)

4. PHOTO GRID (Masonry):
   - Use CSS columns: 4 on desktop, 3 on tablet, 2 on mobile
   - Gap: 20px between images
   - Each photo card:
     * Rounded corners (8px)
     * Shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
     * Hover: scale 1.02, shadow increases
     * Checkbox appears on hover (top-left, white bg)
     * Download icon appears on hover (bottom-right, white bg circle)

5. BULK DOWNLOAD:
   - When photos selected:
     * Floating bottom bar appears with:
       - Number selected
       - "Deselect all" link
       - "Download Selected" button (blue)
   - Click download = each file downloads individually (browser handles multiple)
   - Select all checkbox in header selects all visible photos
   - Download all button downloads all photos

6. LIGHTBOX:
   - Click photo to open
   - Fullscreen with black overlay (90% opacity)
   - Current photo centered
   - Left/right arrows to navigate
   - Close button (X) top-right
   - Download button top-right next to close
   - Photo counter bottom (e.g., "5/24")

7. SAMPLE DATA FOR TESTING:
   - Update seed data to include actual image URLs (use placeholder images from unsplash or picsum)
   - Example: https://picsum.photos/400/600?random=1

8. STYLING DETAILS:
   - Background: #FAFAFA
   - Buttons: blue (#3B82F6) with white text, rounded-full, px-4 py-2
